  title={Next-Gen Profiling of Tumor-resident Stem Cells using Machine learning},
  abstract={Tumor-resident stem cells, also known as cancer stem cells (CSCs), constitute a subgroup within tumors, play a crucial role in fostering resistance to treatment and the recurrence of tumors, and pose significant challenges for conventional therapeutic methods. Existing approaches for identifying CSCs face notable hurdles related to scalability, reproducibility, and technical consistency across different cancer types due to the adaptable nature of CSCs. In this context, we introduce OSCORP, an innovative machine-learning-driven approach. This methodology quantifies and identifies CSCs, achieving almost 99% accuracy using biopsy bulk RNAseq data. OSCORP leverages genetic similarities between normal and cancer stem cells. By categorizing CSCs into four distinct yet dynamic potency states, this approach provides insights into the differentiation landscape of CSCs, unveiling previously undisclosed facets of tumor heterogeneity. In evaluations conducted on patient samples across 22 cancer types, OSCORP revealed clinical, transcriptomic, and immunological signatures associated with each CSC state. It has emerged as a comprehensive tool for understanding and addressing the complexities of cancer stem cells. Ultimately, OSCORP opens up new possibilities for more effective personalized cancer therapies and holds the potential to serve as a clinical tool for monitoring patient-specific CSC changes during treatment or follow-up care.},
