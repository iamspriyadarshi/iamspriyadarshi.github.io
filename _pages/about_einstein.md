I'm currently in my final year as an undergraduate student at [Ashoka University](https://www.ashoka.edu.in), where I'm passionately pursuing my major in Biological Science and minor in Computer Science. My research endeavors revolve around the fascinating realm of Computational Biology, where I aim to harness the power of Computer Science to address biological challenges. I'm specifically interested in Computational Oncology, which involves leveraging data-driven methodologies to create innovative solutions for the detection, therapy, and control of cancer.

Currently, I am working under the supervision of [Prof. Shubhasis Haldar](https://www.shubhasis-haldar-cmt.com/) from [S.N. Bose National Centre for Basic Sciences](https://www.bose.res.in/) and [Prof. Debayan Gupta](https://debayangupta.com/) from [Ashoka University](https://www.ashoka.edu.in). Beyond academics, I find joy in the game of Pool, a passion that adds balance to my life.
