I am currently pursuing a Postgraduate Diploma in Computer Science with a minor in Chemistry at [Ashoka University](https://www.ashoka.edu.in). I previously completed my bachelor's degree at Ashoka University, majoring in Biological Science and minoring in Computer Science. My research endeavors revolve around the fascinating realm of Computational Biology, where I aim to harness the power of Computer Science to address biological challenges. I'm specifically interested in Computational Oncology, which involves leveraging data-driven methodologies to create innovative solutions for the detection, therapy, and control of cancer. Additionally, I have a keen interest in Computational Drug Discovery, focusing on using computational techniques to identify and develop new therapeutic drugs.

Currently, I am working under the supervision of [Prof. Shubhasis Haldar](https://www.shubhasis-haldar-cmt.com/) from [S.N. Bose National Centre for Basic Sciences](https://www.bose.res.in/), and [Prof. Sandeep Juneja](https://www.tcs.tifr.res.in/~sandeepj/) and [Prof. Debayan Gupta](https://debayangupta.com/) from [Ashoka University](https://www.ashoka.edu.in). Beyond academics, I find joy in the game of Pool, a passion that adds balance to my life.
